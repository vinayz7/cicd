# DevOps Exercise #1

* Deploy a web application to a cloud provider of your choice. This web application can be something you have written yourself or an open-source project.
* Deploy the web application as a Docker Container.
* Deploy the Docker Container using Kubernetes.
* Any supporting infrastructure should be configured and deployed as code (e.g. Terraform)
* Bonus points for any build and deployment automation employed in the deployment of the web application.
* Bonus points for demonstrating the ability to deploy, destroy and re-deploy the web application and any supporting infrastructure.
* Include all code and artefacts you create to complete this exercise within this repository for review.



Steps to execute

1. Create AWS Account
2. Get a Amazon ec2 instance
3. Install terraform in it
  curl -O https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.10/terraform_0.14.10_linux_amd64.zip
	sudo su
	unzip terraform_0.14.10_linux_amd64.zip -d /usr/bin/
	terraform -v
4. Configure aws  
  aws configure  
  provide   
  	Access Key ID:,  
	Secret Access Key:  
	region:us-east-2   
	output: json  
	
Also configure "Access key id" and "Secret Key" according to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html
This is required in terraform.

5. install git  
  yum install git -y  
  
6. git clone https://github.com/vilasvarghese/devops-exercise-1-infra-vilasvarghese  
  Replace this with your account if you have forked. 
7. cd devops-exercise-1-infra-vilasvarghese/terraform  
8. Make necessary configurational changes to  
  https://github.com/vilasvarghese/devops-exercise-1-infra-vilasvarghese/blob/main/terraform/variables.tf  
  https://github.com/vilasvarghese/devops-exercise-1-infra-vilasvarghese/blob/main/terraform/terraform.tfvars  
9.  terraform init  
10. terraform plan  
11. terraform apply  
12. Launch an ec2 instance  
  curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp  
  sudo mv /tmp/eksctl /usr/local/bin  
  sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/eksctl /usr/bin/eksctl  
  eksctl version  
  eksctl create cluster --name my-cluster --region us-east-2 --fargate  

  Setup kubectl to work with remote kubernetes master according to the instructions given in the link  
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html  
  since we are using amazon instance - it already has aws.  
  Connect to jenkins instance and do the following   
  
  N.B: This would allow the jenkins server instance to work with a remote kubernetes (setup kubectl to work remotely in aws)
  
  aws configure  
  aws sts get-caller-identity  
  aws update-kubeconfig  
  curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"   
  cp kubectl /usr/local/bin/   
  sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/kubectl /usr/bin/kubectl   
  chmod 777 /usr/local/bin/kubectl  

13. Setup jenkins to execute a ci/cd job
  Login to <jenkins instance ip>:8080
  Find the password from sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword and enter the same.
  
  Install Docker plugin and GitHub Integration Plugin
  Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins → Available.
  
  Create Credentials
  Docker Hub: Click Credentials → global → Add Credentials, choose Username with password as Kind, enter the Docker Hub username and password and use dockerHubCredentials for ID.

GitHub: Click Credentials → Global → Add Credentials , choose Username with password as Kind, enter the GitHub username and password and use gitHubCredentials for ID.
(N.B: For now i have hardcoded this in the yaml files - kindly modify the same rather than creating these credentials)

Create a Freestyle job (not pipeline)
Copy paste the following script

gitHub repo: https://github.com/vilasvarghese/devops-exercise-1-infra-vilasvarghese
Modify the branch from master to main
Copy the contents of https://github.com/vilasvarghese/devops-exercise-1-infra-vilasvarghese/blob/main/JenkinsScript to the shell script section.
14. Give access to jenkins user to execute aws and kubectl commands
	cp -r /home/<user>/.kube /var/lib/jenkins/  
	systemctl restart jenkins  
	
	cd /var/lib/jenkins/.kube  
	chown jenkins:jenkins config  
	ls -ld config  
	
	sudo -su jenkins  
	aws configure  
	#aws update-kubeconfig
	aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster name> --region <region name>
	chmod 777 ~/.kube/config  
	
15.Execute the job.


16. Don't forget to do terraform destroy once you are done with this.
